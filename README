Badge Format
============

Strawman example:

{
 "schema": "https://example.com/badge/1",
 "mustSupport": [],

 "title": "School of Webcraft Responder",
 "description": "This badge is in recognition of the helpful responses you have provided to fellow members of the School of Webcraft.",
 "timestamp": "1288882617",
 "issuer": "https://badger.mozilla.com/",
 "badgeURL": "https://badger.mozilla.com/badges/asdf1234",
 "issuee": [{"type": "email", "id": "thunder@mozilla.com"},
            {"type": "openid", "id": "https://id.sandmill.org/"}]
}

Key points:

* schema attr is an opaque string that we can change to make
  backwards-incompatible changes to the format.
* mustSupport attr is an array of opaque strings which specify schema-optional
  attributes/concepts which are nevertheless required to parse this particular
  badge instance.
* issuer attr is the entity issuing the badge
* badgeURL attr is a unique URL for this badge instance (which could be shared
  if a group of people were all issued the same badge)
* issuee attr is the person who owns (has been issued) the badge. All of the
  identities in the array are considered equivalent for verification purposes,
  but preference should be given to IDs appearing first.
